# Pressure-Volume-PV-Loop-Analysis-Framework
A fully-automated framework to analyse patient-specific cardiac function by providing only paths for where the cardiac catheter raw pressure waveforms data and CIM geometries for volume traces are located. 

The framework was written in both Matlab and Python languages. 

## This repository contains
